Jekyll is a static site generator, which means you can use templates, generate pages from data files, and a bunch of other cool things you don’t normally get with plain ol’ static sites.  ",

The first month has actually been an interesting mix of work. I’m supposed to develop the front end for key products using Angular, but outside of ensuring cross-browser compatibility, all of my development has been for miscellaneous (and unplanned) things!  ",
